# RedditGallery

Simple WPF and Avalonia application to view images from Subreddits.

Currently set to "r/unixporn", but preparations for letting the user choose the subreddit they want to see have already been done.

The Avalonia version currently has some issues regarding the zoom feature, so it is probably going to be removed soon.

Needs Reddit API credentials, which are not included.
